# Async actions don't have a timeout by default (because MP FT spec doesn't require it), but we define one
# to make sure tests don't hang (the smallrye.hystrix.async.timeout.enabled system property must exist)
# Of course the timeout value needs to be high enough -- some tests require at least 2 seconds
